# Cmpt-276-Project
Cmpt 276 Project - Coffee Club 

A project for Cmpt 276 which was a mobile android app designed to provide an interface for the user to make purchases and subscribe to mocked real life services (Smart vending machines). 
It was created using Android Studio, and various API's within.
The app used google maps API to display location of vending machines, as well as paypal API to simulate payments. 
The database behind the app was hosted online (no longer currently) and created using mySQL. It was able to update on the internet in real time and display real time results in the app.
User passwords were hashed in the database to provide protection to sensitive information for users.
